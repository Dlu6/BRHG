## üîç What Was Fixed

### Before (v1.0.0 - Rejected)

```json
"permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "scripting", "tabs", "notifications"]
```

### After (v1.0.1 - Fixed)

```json
"permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "tabs", "notifications"]
```

The extension never actually used the `scripting` permission, so removing it doesn't affect functionality but makes it compliant with Chrome Web Store policies.
