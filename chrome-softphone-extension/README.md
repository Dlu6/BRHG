### Debugging & Troubleshooting

- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Detailed error descriptions with specific guidance for each issue type
- **Smart Token Handling**: Automatically handles tokens with or without Bearer prefix from backend
- **Console Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the authentication and session flow
- **Development Mode**: Additional debug information shown in development environment
- **Session Tracking**: Real-time session count and status monitoring
- **Error Categories**:
  - üîê Authentication Token Errors
  - üö´ License User Limit Reached
  - üîí Concurrent Session Detected
  - üìã Feature Not Licensed
  - ‚è∞ Session Expired
  - ‚ùå General Session Errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"JWT malformed" Error**: Token format issue - try logging out and logging in again
2. **"Maximum user limit reached"**: License allows limited concurrent users - wait for others to logout
3. **"Already logged in elsewhere"**: Only one session per user - logout from other devices first
4. **"Feature not enabled"**: Contact administrator to upgrade license plan
5. **Authentication fails**: Check server connection and credentials
6. **"Admin access required" Error**: Fixed route ordering issue where specific routes were conflicting with parameterized routes

### Technical Notes

- **Token Compatibility**: Handles tokens with or without Bearer prefix for backend compatibility
- **Route Ordering**: Specific routes (like `/current`, `/session-count`) must be defined before parameterized routes (like `/:id`) in Express.js
- **Session Management**: All session management endpoints are accessible to authenticated users, not just admins
- **License Validation**: The system validates licenses on every session creation and periodically during heartbeats
- **Simplified Flow**: Removed authentication test step for cleaner login process

### Session Management & User Limits

- **Per-User Licensing**: Each license specifies maximum concurrent users
- **Single Session Enforcement**: One active session per username across all devices
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Prevents concurrent logins from different devices
- **Automatic Session Cleanup**: Sessions are cleaned up on logout or extension shutdown
- **Session Heartbeat**: Keeps sessions alive and validates license status every 30 seconds
- **User Count Display**: Shows current users vs. maximum allowed (e.g., "3/5 users")
- **Graceful Limit Handling**: Clear error messages when user limits are reached

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`Ctrl+Shift+M`**: Restore dismissed floating button to default position

## Debugging the Extension

To debug the background script, click the "service worker" link in the extension's card on the `chrome://extensions` page. This will open the developer tools for the background script.

To debug the content script and the softphone bar UI, open the developer tools on any page where the extension is active (i.e., any page that is not a Chrome internal page).

## Authentication and License Validation

The extension uses a flexible authentication system with integrated license management:

1.  **Optional Login**: Users can click the floating button or extension icon to trigger the login modal
2.  **Content Script**: Manages the floating toggle button and softphone interface
3.  **Background Script**: Handles SIP registration, WebSocket connections, and call management
4.  **License Validation**: Real-time license checking with automatic feature enablement/disabling
5.  **Progressive Enhancement**: Interface adapts based on authentication status and license validity
6.  **Demo Mode**: Non-authenticated users see a limited interface for demonstration purposes

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks floating button or extension icon
2. Login modal appears (can be cancelled)
3. Upon successful login, SIP credentials are stored
4. License validation occurs automatically
5. Background script handles WebRTC registration
6. Interface adapts based on license status and available features
7. Full or limited functionality becomes available based on license

## User Experience Enhancements

- Button visibility state is remembered across sessions
- User preferences persist until manually changed

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements have proper titles and hover states
- Keyboard shortcut for restoring dismissed buttons
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Non-Intrusive Design

- Small floating button that can be moved or dismissed
- No blocking modals unless explicitly requested
- Graceful degradation for non-authenticated users
- Optional functionality that doesn't interfere with normal page usage
- Temporary restore hints that auto-disappear to avoid clutter
- License-aware interface that clearly communicates available functionality
- Progressive feature enablement based on authentication and license status
